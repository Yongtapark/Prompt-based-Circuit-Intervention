# Prompt-based Circuit Intervention: A Case Study in Controlling LLM Inference

*Inspired by Anthropic's research paper, "On the Biology of a Large Language Model", this project demonstrates that the paper's concept of circuit intervention can be practically replicated and controlled solely through structured prompting.*

---

## Abstract

This repository documents an experiment demonstrating that a specific prompt structure can override a Large Language Model's (LLM) strong fact-based associations to produce a controlled, non-factual output. When asked for the capital of the state containing Dallas, the model's default, factually correct answer "Austin" was successfully suppressed. Instead, by using a "structural prompt" that mimics the model's internal reasoning process, it was guided to answer with the capital of California. This method achieved a **94% success rate over 150 trials**, whereas conventional plain-text prompts with the same constraints failed completely. This finding suggests a powerful, non-invasive method for steering model behavior, with significant implications for AI safety, controllability, and interpretability.

## The Core Finding: Structure Over Semantics

The key discovery is that the **syntactic structure** of a prompt can hold higher precedence than its **semantic content**. The model appears to interpret prompts that describe computational graphs not as mere text, but as a set of high-priority instructions, overriding even its most robustly learned factual knowledge.

## Experiment Design

- **Model:** Anthropic Claude
- **Date of Experiment:** {실험을 수행한 날짜, 예: June 2024}
- **Objective:** To suppress the factually correct answer ("Austin") to the query "the capital of the state containing Dallas is" and force an output based on an arbitrary rule ("Think about California").

### Group A: The Structural Prompt (The "Key")

This prompt format, which I call a "Structural Prompt" or "Inference Graph Prompt", was used. It explicitly outlines a reasoning path, including an `INHIBIT` command.

*(The full prompt is available in the `/prompts` directory)*
Use code with caution.

### Group B: Plain-text Prompts (The "Control")

Various conventional prompts were used to establish a baseline. All of them failed to suppress the default answer.

*(Examples are available in the `/prompts` directory)*
Use code with caution.
"What is the capital of the state containing Dallas? Important: Do not think about Texas. You must think about California instead."

## Results

| Prompt Type        | Trials | Success (Controlled Output) | Failure ("Austin") | Success Rate |
| ------------------ | ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| **Structural Prompt**  | 150    | 141 (incl. refusals)        | 9                  | **94%**      |
| **Plain-text Prompt**  | >10    | 0                           | All                | **0%**       |

*"Success" was defined as any output other than "Austin", including "Sacramento" or a refusal to answer, as it demonstrated the override was effective.*

## Implications

1.  **Controllability:** This technique provides a new, powerful "handle" to steer model behavior without fine-tuning. It could be used to enforce constraints, select desired reasoning paths, or reduce undesirable outputs.
2.  **AI Safety:** A "guardrail prompt" structured this way could be prefixed to user inputs to preemptively block harmful or forbidden inference paths before they are even considered by the model.
3.  **Interpretability:** This method serves as a non-invasive "probe". By constructing hypothetical reasoning paths as prompts and observing the model's reactions, we can test hypotheses about its internal mechanisms.

## How to Reproduce

1.  Copy the content of `prompts/successful_prompt.txt`.
2.  Paste it into a session with a capable LLM like Anthropic's Claude.
3.  Observe that the model's output is not "Austin".
